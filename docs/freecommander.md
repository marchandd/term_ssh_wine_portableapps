Description
-----------

FreeCommander(2009.02b) English/French by Marek Jasinski is a Windows files and 
directories manager with multi-tools.  
New version (FreeCommander XE) failed at start up even when winetricks options 
are changed = Garbage Features...

### Assigned alias ###
- :computer: `freecommander`

Particularity
-------------

Free Software similar to Double Commander cross platform running on Linux, but 
with a 
lot of user language translations.

### Multi-tools main specialities ###
- Multi panel and quick files viewer.
- Very quickly search (on Windows system).
- Folder list maker, size of folder.
- MD5 checksums, pack.
- Split files, multi renames.
- Folder synchronization.

Silver state Features
---------------------

Seem to be functional enough to manage directories, files name but not 
data inside the file.  
However it's a great software on Windows and personally I 
wanted to discover it evolving on Linux environment.

### Main working tests ###
- Multi panel and quick files viewer,
- Search files, comparison and renaming files,
- Features working like tree file navigation, filters,
- Quick view and edit files (read without save it), 
- Pack and unpack, split file, create MD5, 
- Multi-renames, directories selections and views,
- Size of folders display, navigation history display,
- Folder list maker, synchronize directories,
- Saving preferences.

### Troubles detect ###
- :full_moon_with_face: Double click on file doesn't open/execute it...
- :full_moon_with_face: Edit properties or copy paste files doesn't work.
- :sun_with_face: Edit file is possible but Saving occurs violation error.

### Features not tested ###
- Features specific to Windows environment (DOS, Wipe, Thumbnails, 
Desktop snapshot...)
- Network and USB key reading.
